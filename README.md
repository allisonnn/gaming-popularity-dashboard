# ðŸŽ® Gaming popularity dashboard

This application (deployed at [https://allisonnn.github.io/gaming-popularity-dashboard](https://allisonnn.github.io/gaming-popularity-dashboard)) provides an easy way to explore some data in gaming industry, showing trends in game releases, what genres are popular, how sales compare in different regions, and which games are top-rated by using the data from [Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv).

## Architecture

**1. Folder structure**

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ public
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ gamepad.svg # For the favicon.
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx # React entry point.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components # Components for chart.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ context # Contexts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ helpers # Helper functions.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ hooks # Custom hooks e.g. useNumOfReleaseByGenre.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.css
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mocks
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ source.json # The json file stores the dataset.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ test # Test utilities.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ types # Types definition.
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ vite-env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.node.json
â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
```

**2. Utilizing React Context API**

The project uses Context API to provide a global state(data source) that can be accessed by any component within the component tree, to eliminate too much prop drilling. This global state is initialized and managed in the `App.tsx` file, which serves as the entry point of the application.

**3. Data Management**

The data used in the context is prepared and tidied before being stored in the context, ensuring that components consume clean and contentful info. This preprocessing step simplifies data manipulation in the application.

**4. Uitilizing custom hooks**

In the `hook` dir, custom hooks like `useNumOfReleaseByGenre.tsx` abstract the logic for accessing or computing specific pieces of state, such as the number of releases by genre by manufactuer. These hooks provide reusable logic that can be easily utilized by different components.

**5. Potential reusable components**

The `components` dir contains potential reusable component for the charts, encapsulating the visualization logic in a `Chart.tsx` and separating from the parent UI logic. This approach will also make the components easier to be tested.

**6. Type declarations**

Custom types have been created under `types` dir, to ensure the shape of the data and props passed around the components are consistent and error free.

## Technical choices

**1. Vite + React + Typescript**

Vite significantly accelerates development with its fast server start-up and HMR, requiring very minimal configuration, which makes it a good choice for this assignment.

**2.`visx` for data visualization**

`victory` doesn't have much activity on its GitHub, so I'm concerned it might not be well-maintained. When comparing between `visx` and `recharts`, `visx` is more like a low-level data visualization library which provides more control over customization. This should make it more scalable in the long term or for a larger scope.

**3. TailwindCSS for styling**

TailwindCSS is easy to use and speeds up some UI prototyping. It has ready-to-use design pieces which means less time writing custom code, so it's a pretty good choice for a solo project like this assignment.

**4. Vitest for unit testing**

I used Vitest because of its streamlined setup, fast test execution, and seamless integration with Vite, which reduced potential maintenance effort.

**5. Github Pages and Actions for deployment**

Since this is just a static web page, I'm using Github Pages to host the app and using the Github Actions to simplify the release process.

## Deploy instructions

This project leverages automated deployment via GitHub Actions, configured to trigger a deployment cycle upon new commits to the `main` branch. Any changes pushed to `main` will initiate the deployment process, and the application will be updated soon.

**Disable automatic deployment**

To disable the automated deployment, you can follow the official document from Github about [disabling a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow#disabling-a-workflow).

## TODOs

This section listed potential opportunities for converting this assignment into a fully functional product in the future showing dynamic data loaded from server.

- [ ] Improve the UX for a super large dataset
  - [ ] Show loading indicator.
  - [ ] Implement scrollbar for bar charts, utilizing virtulization.
- [ ] Implement more unit tests and system tests following the production readiness checklist above.
- [ ] Identify and address potential edge cases
  - [ ] Show meaningful error messages for broken empty dataset.
  - [ ] Implement 404/403 error messages.
  - [ ] Find the performance limitation, for example if the dataset is super large, we might end up with thousands of svg elements on the page, which cause some performance issue and we need to switch to canvas at that point.
  - [ ] Mobile devices:
    - [ ] Reduce number of labels on `AxisBottom` in the release trend chart, or try a different way otherwise the labels might have overlay.
    - [ ] Release trend chart is not very readable on a very small mobile screen due to the width limit.
- [ ] UX improvements
  - [ ] Add additional filters(e.g. filter by games released after 2000) for each chart to allow for more granular data exploration.
  - [ ] Introduce a detail page feature, enabling users to look into more details such as checking top-rated games by screenshos, score, genre, and description, or exploring popular genres within each region through the regional sales widget.
  - [ ] Work with designers to polish the UI.
- [ ] A11y improvements
  - [ ] Using pattern fill for bar chart and pie chart.
  - [ ] Improve color contrast ratio.
- [ ] Using i18n localize content.
- [ ] Extracting common UI pieces like card heading component, useTooltip hook.
